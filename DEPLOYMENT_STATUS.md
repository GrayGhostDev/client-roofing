### Current Status: Building

⏳ **Deployment is in progress**

The backend is currently building on Render. With all dependencies resolved, the build should complete successfully.

**Monitoring shows:** Backend not yet responding (checked for 6 minutes)
**Likely reason:** Build is still in progress (many dependencies to install)

### What to Do Next

**Option 1: Wait for Build to Complete (Recommended)**

Free tier services can take 5-10 minutes to build, especially with many dependencies like torch, transformers, etc.

Check build status in Render Dashboard:
https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d3mlmmur433s73abuar0

**Option 2: Monitor from Command Line**

Run the monitoring script:
```bash
/tmp/monitor_deployment.sh
```

Or manually check health endpoint:
```bash
curl https://srv-d3mlmmur433s73abuar0.onrender.com/health
```

**Option 3: Check Build Logs**

If you want to see real-time build progress, visit the Render dashboard and click on the "Logs" tab.

### Verification Checklist

- [x] Environment variables set via Render API
- [x] All missing dependencies added to requirements.txt
- [x] Dependency conflicts resolved (httpx downgraded)
- [x] Code committed and pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Deployment completes successfully (in progress)
- [ ] Health endpoint returns 200 with "healthy" status
- [ ] API endpoints work: `/api/leads`, `/api/customers`
- [ ] Update Streamlit secrets with production backend URL
- [ ] Test full stack functionality

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Check backend health
curl -k "https://srv-d3mlmmur433s73abuar0.onrender.com/health"

# Full verification
./verify-deployment.sh

# Manual redeploy trigger (if needed)
curl -X POST "https://api.render.com/deploy/srv-d3mlmmur433s73abuar0?key=mT_YPrdnfTk"
```
