**CRITICAL MISSING IMPLEMENTATION:**
This is the main gap in Week 10. Voice AI records calls and has basic transcription,
but missing dedicated service for action item extraction and CRM automation.

**Required Service:**
```python
# backend/app/services/call_transcription.py
class CallTranscriptionService:
    async def transcribe_call(call_id: str) -> Dict
    async def extract_action_items(transcript: str) -> List[ActionItem]
    async def update_lead_status(lead_id: int, transcript: str) -> None
    async def schedule_follow_ups(action_items: List) -> None
    async def ensure_compliance(call_id: str) -> bool
```

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days development + testing

**Transcription Features:**
```python
# Auto-extraction logic
ACTION ITEMS:
  - "I'll send you a quote by Friday" → Create task for sales rep
  - "Call me next week" → Schedule follow-up call
  - "I need to discuss with my spouse" → Flag as decision-making stage

STATUS UPDATES:
  - "I'm ready to move forward" → Update status to "Ready to Close"
  - "I want to get another quote" → Update to "Comparing Options"
  - "Not interested right now" → Update to "Long-term Nurture"

DATA EXTRACTION:
  - Property details (address, roof type, age)
  - Budget range mentioned
  - Timeline/urgency
  - Competitor mentions
```

**Success Metrics:**
- Save 30 minutes/day per sales rep (12 reps = 6 hours daily)

I noticed your property at {address} in Bloomfield Hills was built in 1985,
which means your roof is likely nearing the end of its 30-year lifespan.

Last week's hail storm on {date} caused significant damage to roofs in your
area. Your neighbors at {nearby_address} recently upgraded to impact-resistant
shingles through their insurance coverage.

Given your home's value (${property_value}), we recommend our premium
architectural shingles that complement Bloomfield Hills' luxury aesthetic.

Would you like a complimentary inspection this week? I have availability on

Best regards,
{sales_rep_name}
