## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Supabase API rate limits | Medium | High | Implement Redis caching, optimize queries |
| Pusher connection limits | Low | Medium | Use channel batching, upgrade plan if needed |
| Third-party API failures | High | Medium | Retry logic, fallback workflows, error handling |
| Data migration complexity | Medium | High | Phased migration, extensive testing, rollback plan |
| Performance degradation | Medium | High | Load testing, query optimization, caching strategy |

### Business Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Low user adoption | Medium | Critical | Comprehensive training, change management, user feedback |
| Data quality issues | High | High | Import validation, cleanup scripts, data governance |
| Integration failures | Medium | Medium | Manual fallback workflows, vendor SLAs |
| Budget overruns | Low | Medium | Phased approach, MVP first, monitor spend |
