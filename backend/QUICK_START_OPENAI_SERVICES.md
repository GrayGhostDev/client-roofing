## ⚡ 5-Minute Setup

### Step 1: Verify Environment (1 minute)

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Check if .env file exists
ls -la .env

# If .env doesn't exist, create from example
cp .env.example .env

# Verify OpenAI API key is set
grep "OPENAI_API_KEY" .env
# Should show: OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-..."
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies (2 minutes)

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Key dependencies installed:
# - openai (GPT-4o integration)
# - fastapi (API framework)
# - sqlalchemy (database ORM)
# - pydantic (data validation)
```

### Step 3: Start Services (1 minute)

```bash
# Start the backend API server
python3 main.py

# Server starts on http://localhost:8001
# API documentation: http://localhost:8001/docs
```

### Step 4: Test Services (1 minute)

```bash
# Test 1: Call Transcription Service
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/transcription/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "transcript": "Customer called asking about roof replacement. They mentioned their roof is 15 years old and they noticed some shingles missing after the recent storm. They want a quote for a complete replacement with premium materials.",
    "lead_id": 1,
    "call_duration_seconds": 180
  }'

# Expected response:
# {
#   "summary": "Customer inquiring about roof replacement...",
#   "action_items": [...],
#   "sentiment": "positive",
#   "buying_signals": ["requesting_quote", "ready_to_act"]
# }

# Test 2: Email Personalization Service
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/email/subject-line \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "lead_id": 1,
    "template_type": "initial_contact"
  }'

# Expected response:
# {
#   "subject": "John, Your Bloomfield Hills Home Deserves Premium Protection",
#   "confidence": 0.95,
#   "personalization_factors": [...]
# }
```

## 🎯 Common Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Analyze Call Recording

**Scenario**: You just finished a call with a potential customer and want to extract action items and update their lead status.

```python
from app.services.call_transcription import CallTranscriptionService

# Initialize service
service = CallTranscriptionService()

# Analyze call
result = await service.analyze_call_transcript(
    transcript="Customer called about roof replacement. They want a quote by Friday.",
    lead_id=123,
    call_duration_seconds=240
)

# Result contains:
# - summary: Brief overview of conversation
# - action_items: List of tasks to complete
# - sentiment: positive/neutral/negative
# - buying_signals: List of detected signals
# - lead_stage: Updated lead stage
# - recommended_next_steps: Suggested actions
```

**What Happens Automatically**:
- ✅ Lead status updated in database
- ✅ Action items created and assigned
- ✅ Follow-up scheduled based on urgency
- ✅ Buying signals tracked
- ✅ Sentiment logged for team review

### Use Case 2: Generate Personalized Email

**Scenario**: You want to send a follow-up email to a lead with personalized content.

```python
from app.services.intelligence.email_personalization import EmailPersonalizationService

# Initialize service
service = EmailPersonalizationService()

# Generate personalized email
email = await service.generate_personalized_email(
    lead_id=123,
    template_type="follow_up",
    context={
        "property_value": 450000,
        "recent_storm": True,
        "neighborhood": "Bloomfield Hills"
    }
)

# Email contains:
# - subject: Personalized subject line
# - html_content: Fully formatted email
# - plain_text: Plain text version
# - send_time_recommendation: Best time to send
# - personalization_data: What was personalized
```

**What Gets Personalized**:
- ✅ Subject line with first name and property detail
- ✅ Content tailored to home value (premium messaging)
- ✅ Weather urgency if storm detected
- ✅ Neighborhood social proof
- ✅ Send time optimized for engagement

### Use Case 3: Batch Process Leads

**Scenario**: You have 50 new leads and want to send personalized initial contact emails to all of them.

```python
from app.services.intelligence.email_personalization import EmailPersonalizationService
from app.models.lead_sqlalchemy import Lead
from app.database import get_db_session

# Get all new leads
db = next(get_db_session())
new_leads = db.query(Lead).filter(Lead.status == "new").all()

# Generate emails for all
service = EmailPersonalizationService(db)

for lead in new_leads:
    email = await service.generate_personalized_email(
        lead_id=lead.id,
        template_type="initial_contact"
    )

    # Send email via your email service
    await send_email(
        to=lead.email,
        subject=email["subject"],
        html=email["html_content"],
        plain_text=email["plain_text"]
    )

    print(f"✅ Sent personalized email to {lead.first_name} {lead.last_name}")
```

## 💡 Best Practices

### 1. Cost Optimization

**Cache Repeated Requests**:
```python
# Don't regenerate same email multiple times
cached_emails = {}

if lead_id in cached_emails:
    email = cached_emails[lead_id]
else:
    email = await service.generate_personalized_email(lead_id)
    cached_emails[lead_id] = email
```

**Use Appropriate Temperature Settings**:
```python
# For subject lines (creative): temperature=0.8
# For summaries (accurate): temperature=0.3
# For action items (precise): temperature=0.2
```

### 2. Error Handling

**Always Use Try/Except**:
```python
try:
    result = await service.analyze_call_transcript(transcript, lead_id)
except OpenAIError as e:
    logger.error(f"OpenAI API error: {e}")
    # Fallback to template-based analysis
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
    # Alert team
```

### 3. Rate Limiting

**Implement Backoff for Rate Limits**:
```python
import asyncio

async def with_retry(func, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return await func()
        except RateLimitError:
            wait_time = 2 ** attempt  # 2s, 4s, 8s
            await asyncio.sleep(wait_time)
    raise Exception("Max retries exceeded")
```

### 4. Monitoring

**Track Key Metrics**:
```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Log every API call
logger.info(f"GPT-4o call: {operation}", extra={
    "lead_id": lead_id,
    "operation": operation,
    "tokens_used": response.usage.total_tokens,
    "cost": calculate_cost(response.usage)
})
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem 1: "OpenAI API key not found"

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check if .env file exists
ls -la backend/.env

# Add API key to .env
echo 'OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-YOUR_KEY_HERE"' >> backend/.env

# Restart server
python3 main.py
```

### Problem 2: "Import Error: cannot import name 'get_session'"

**Solution**: Already fixed! The correct import is:
```python
from app.database import get_db_session  # ✅ Correct
```

### Problem 3: "Service responding slowly"

**Possible Causes**:
1. **Network latency to OpenAI**: Check internet connection
2. **Database queries**: Add indexes for common queries
3. **Token usage**: Reduce prompt length if possible

**Debug**:
```python
import time

start = time.time()
result = await service.generate_email(lead_id)
elapsed = time.time() - start

print(f"Generation took {elapsed:.2f}s")
# Expected: 3-5 seconds
# If > 10 seconds, investigate
```

### Problem 4: "Rate limit exceeded"

**Solution**:
```python
# Option 1: Implement backoff (recommended)
await asyncio.sleep(60)  # Wait 1 minute

# Option 2: Upgrade OpenAI plan
# Go to platform.openai.com/account/limits

# Option 3: Queue requests
from queue import Queue
request_queue = Queue()
# Process queue with delay between requests
```
