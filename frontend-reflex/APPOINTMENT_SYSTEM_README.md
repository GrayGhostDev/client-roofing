    id: str
    title: str
    description: Optional[str] = None
    appointment_type: str  # consultation, inspection, project_work, follow_up, estimate
    status: str  # scheduled, confirmed, in_progress, completed, cancelled, no_show
    scheduled_date: str
    duration_minutes: int
    end_time: Optional[str] = None
    entity_type: str  # lead, customer, project

    outcome_notes: Optional[str] = None
    reminder_sent: bool = False
    confirmed_by_customer: bool = False
    created_at: str
    updated_at: str
```

### State Management

The appointment system adds comprehensive state management to `AppState`:

#### Core State Variables
- `appointments: List[Appointment] = []` - All appointments
- `selected_appointment_id: Optional[str] = None` - Currently selected appointment
- `appointment_modal_open: bool = False` - Modal visibility state
- `calendar_view_mode: str = "month"` - Current calendar view
- `calendar_selected_date: str = ""` - Selected date in calendar

#### Filtering and Search
- `appointment_type_filter: str = "all"` - Filter by appointment type
- `appointment_status_filter: str = "all"` - Filter by status
- `appointment_assigned_to_filter: str = "all"` - Filter by team member
- `appointment_search_query: str = ""` - Search query

### Component Structure

```
components/appointments/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py                     # Package exports
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ appointment_calendar.py         # Main calendar component
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ appointment_modal.py            # Create/edit appointment modal
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ appointment_list.py             # List view with filtering
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ appointment_detail_modal.py     # Appointment details view
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ appointments_dashboard.py       # Dashboard integration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard_with_appointments.py  # Enhanced dashboard example
```

### API Integration

The system integrates with backend APIs for:
- `GET /api/appointments` - Load appointments
- `POST /api/appointments` - Create new appointment
- `PATCH /api/appointments/{id}` - Update appointment
- `DELETE /api/appointments/{id}` - Delete appointment

## Usage Examples

### Basic Integration

```python
from .components.appointments import appointments_dashboard

# Add to your app
app.add_page(appointments_dashboard, route="/appointments")
```

### Dashboard Widget Integration

```python
from .components.appointments import (
    appointment_summary_widget,
    upcoming_appointments_widget,
    todays_schedule_widget
)

def dashboard():
    return rx.grid(
        main_content(),
        rx.vstack(
            appointment_summary_widget(),
            upcoming_appointments_widget(),
            spacing="4"
        ),
        columns="2"
    )
```

### Programmatic Appointment Creation

```python
# Open appointment modal with pre-filled date
AppState.open_appointment_modal_with_date("2024-01-15", "10:00")

# Create appointment from lead
AppState.update_appointment_form_data("entity_type", "lead")
AppState.update_appointment_form_data("entity_id", lead_id)
AppState.open_appointment_modal()
```

## Customization

### Adding New Appointment Types

1. Update the appointment type list in `appointment_modal.py`:
```python
appointment_types = [
    "initial_consultation",
    "roof_inspection",
    "your_new_type",  # Add here
    # ... existing types
]
```

2. Update backend enum to match

### Custom Calendar Styling

Calendar views can be customized through the component styling:

```python
# Custom time slot styling
rx.box(
    # Your appointment content
    style={
        "cursor": "pointer",
        "&:hover": {
            "background_color": "var(--your-color)"
        }
    }
)
```

### Integration with External Calendars

The system supports integration with:
- Google Calendar (via google_calendar_event_id field)
- Outlook Calendar (via outlook_calendar_event_id field)
- Any iCal-compatible system

## Performance Considerations

### Caching
- Uses `@rx.var(cache=True)` for computed properties
- Filters are cached until data changes
- Calendar views are optimized for large datasets

### Memory Management
- Appointments are loaded on-demand
- Large appointment lists use pagination
- Old appointments can be archived

### Real-time Updates
- WebSocket integration for live updates
- Optimistic UI updates for better UX
- Conflict resolution for concurrent edits

## Security

### Access Control
- Team member-based access restrictions
- Role-based appointment visibility
- Secure API endpoints with authentication

### Data Validation
- Input sanitization on all forms
- Date validation (no past dates for new appointments)
- Duration limits and business hour enforcement

## Testing

The appointment system includes comprehensive test coverage:
- Unit tests for state management
- Integration tests for API calls
- Component testing for UI interactions
- End-to-end testing for user workflows

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Recurring appointment support
- Advanced conflict detection
- Weather integration for outdoor appointments
- Mobile app notifications
- Customer self-scheduling portal
- Advanced analytics and reporting

### API Extensions
- Bulk appointment operations
- Advanced filtering and search
- Export capabilities (CSV, iCal)
- Integration webhooks
