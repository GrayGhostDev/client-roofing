hail Tuesday afternoon. Might want to bring in patio
furniture and park cars in garages if possible. Stay safe!"
```

```
"For those dealing with ice dams this week - try using
a roof rake to remove snow from edges (carefully from ground).
Prevents damage. Happy to share other tips if helpful!"

after yesterday's storm. Remember: legitimate contractors
don't pressure you to sign immediately. Always verify
licenses and get multiple quotes. Protect yourself!"
```

### Response Templates for Common Questions

```
"I've heard good things about [mention 2-3 competitors honestly],
depends what you're looking for. Main thing is get multiple
quotes and check licenses. What kind of work do you need?"

## MONTH 2: BUILDING AUTHORITY

### The Weather Warrior Strategy

#### Proactive Storm Alerts
```

- Shows local knowledge
- Builds trust and gratitude
- Positions you as helpful expert

### Educational Content Calendar

#### Monday: Maintenance Tips
```
"Monday Maintenance Tip: Those black streaks on roofs
aren't dirt - they're algae that feeds on your shingles!
Don't power wash (makes it worse). Gentle cleaning with
proper products is key. Anyone dealt with this successfully?"
```

#### Wednesday: Weather Watch
```
"Michigan Weather Reality: Our roofs endure 140¬∞F summers
to -20¬∞F winters. That's 160 degrees of expansion/contraction!
No wonder they need TLC. What weather damage have you noticed?"
```

#### Friday: Safety First
```
"Weekend Reminder: Please don't get on your roof to check
gutters! Every year people get seriously hurt. Use binoculars
from ground or hire someone. Your safety > clean gutters."
```
