### üìû PHONE SCRIPTS

#### First Contact - Inbound Lead (2-Minute Response)

**Opening:**
```
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from iSwitch Roofs.
I see you just requested information about your roof.
Thanks for reaching out! What specific concerns do you
have that prompted you to contact us?"

[LISTEN - Let them talk]
```

**Discovery Questions:**
```
"That's definitely something we can help with. Let me
ask you a few quick questions to better understand:

1. How long have you been noticing this issue?
2. Has it caused any interior damage yet?
3. Have you had anyone else look at it?
4. What's your timeline for getting this resolved?
5. Is this your forever home or are you planning to sell?"
```

**Setting Appointment:**
```
"Based on what you're telling me, I should definitely
take a look. I have an opening [TODAY at TIME] or
[TOMORROW at TIME]. Which works better for you?

Great! I'll text you confirmation right after this call.
I'll need about 45 minutes to do a thorough inspection
and show you exactly what's going on. Sound good?"
```

#### Missed Call Response (Immediate Text)

```
Hi [Name]! Just tried calling about your roof inquiry.
I have openings TODAY at 2pm or 4pm for a free inspection.
Which works better? - [Your Name] from iSwitch Roofs
```

#### Storm Damage Calls

```
"Hi [Name], I know the storm hit your area hard.
Are you and your family safe? Good, that's what matters.

I can be there in [TIME] to tarp any immediate damage
(no charge) and help you document for insurance. Would
that be helpful?"
```

### üè† IN-HOME PRESENTATION SCRIPTS

#### Door Arrival Protocol

**Text Before Knocking:**
```
"Hi [Name], I'm here for our appointment.
Black truck in driveway. - [Your Name]"
```

**At the Door:**
```
"Hi [Name], [Your Name] from iSwitch Roofs. Thanks for
having me out! Mind if I put on these shoe covers?
I'll be super careful in your home.

Before we look at the roof, what's been your biggest
concern? [LISTEN]

Okay, let me grab my tablet and I'll show you exactly
what I find up there."
```

#### Building Trust Early

```
"Just so you know, I'm not here to pressure you into
anything today. My job is to educate you on what's
happening with your roof and give you options. Fair?"

"Also, I always recommend getting multiple quotes.
An investment this size deserves careful consideration.
I'll give you a detailed written estimate you can
compare with others."
```

---

### üí∞ PRICE PRESENTATION SCRIPTS

#### Good-Better-Best Presentation

```
"Based on my inspection, you have three options:

OPTION 1 - PATCH REPAIR: $2,500
"We can patch the immediate problem area. This stops
the leak but doesn't address underlying issues.
Honestly, this buys you 2-3 years maximum."

OPTION 2 - SECTION REPLACEMENT: $8,500
"We replace the damaged section properly. This solves
the current problem and gives you 5-7 more years.
Most popular choice for homes your age."

OPTION 3 - FULL REPLACEMENT: $18,500
"Complete new roof with 50-year architectural shingles.
Includes warranty, ventilation upgrades, and ice/water
shield. This is your 'never worry again' option."

"Which option makes most sense for your situation?"
```

#### Financing Presentation

```
"I know $18,500 is a significant investment. The good
news is we work with multiple lenders who specialize
in home improvements.

Most of our customers qualify for:
- $0 down
- Payments around $215/month
- Same-as-cash options if paid within 18 months

Takes 5 minutes to check what you qualify for, and it
doesn't affect your credit to look. Should we see what
options you have available?"
```

### üö´ OBJECTION HANDLING SCRIPTS

#### "I need to think about it"

```
"Absolutely, this is a big decision. I wouldn't expect
you to decide on the spot. What specifically would you
like to think about?

[LISTEN]

That makes sense. While it's fresh, what questions can
I answer now to help you make the best decision?"
```

#### "Your price is too high"

```
"I appreciate your honesty. Too high compared to what?

[If they mention competitor price:]
"That's interesting. Was their quote for the exact same
scope of work? Let's compare line by line to make sure
you're getting apples to apples.

[Show value differences]

The question isn't 'What's cheapest?' but 'What protects
your home best for the long term?' Would you agree?"
```

#### "I need to get other quotes"

```
"That's smart! I always recommend that. Here's a
comparison sheet to make it easier. [Hand sheet]

When you get other quotes, make sure to ask:
- Are they licensed and insured?
- What warranty do they provide?
- Do they pull proper permits?
- Who handles issues after installation?

I'm confident when you compare everything, we'll earn
your business. When do you plan to make a decision?"
```

#### "I need to talk to my spouse"

```
"Of course! They should definitely be involved. Are
they available to join us now by phone?

[If no:]
"No problem. When can we all meet together? I find it's
helpful when everyone hears the same information directly.

How about [TOMORROW at TIME]? I'll bring coffee!"
```

#### "Insurance should cover this"

```
"You might be right! Want to call them together right now?
I can help explain the damage in their terms.

[If yes, help with call]
[If no:]
"Here's what you need to tell them: [specific damage details].
I'll email you photos and a detailed report to submit.

If they approve, we're an insurance specialist - we'll
handle all paperwork and bill them directly."
```

### ‚úçÔ∏è CLOSING SCRIPTS

#### The Assumptive Close

```
"So we'll get you on the schedule for Tuesday morning.
Does 8am work or would afternoon be better?"

[If hesitation:]
"Is it the timing that's concerning you or something else?"
```

#### The Urgency Close (When Legitimate)

```
"Just so you know, we have one crew opening next week
before material prices increase on the 1st. That's a
$400 savings if we lock in current pricing. Should we
reserve that spot?"
```

#### The Partnership Close

```
"Look, [Name], I can see you're concerned about making
the right decision. How about this - let me be your
roofing advisor, not a salesperson.

I'll help you evaluate other quotes, answer questions,
even recommend someone else if they're truly better for
your needs. Fair enough?

But based on everything we've discussed, I genuinely
believe we're your best option. Ready to move forward?"
```

#### The Protection Close

```
"Every day this goes unfixed, you risk more damage.
We're talking potential mold, structural issues, even
electrical problems.

The $18,500 investment today prevents a possible $40,000
disaster tomorrow. Doesn't protecting your family's biggest
investment make sense?"
```

Hi [Name],

I haven't heard back about your roof inspection from

2. Decided to wait (totally understand)

Either way, I'll close your file unless I hear otherwise.

If situations change or you need anything roof-related,
I'm always here to help - no hard feelings!

All the best,
[Your Name]

P.S. Seriously, if you went with someone else, I'd love
to know why. Always trying to improve!
