## 12. Conclusion

The iSwitch Roofs CRM system has a solid architectural foundation but requires significant testing and quality improvements before production deployment. The current 0.93% test coverage is unacceptable for a business-critical CRM system.

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. Fix all test import errors
2. Implement basic authentication
3. Add input validation
4. Achieve 25% test coverage within 1 week

### Success Metrics:
- **4-Week Goal:** 80% test coverage, all critical issues resolved
- **Quality Score Target:** 85/100
- **Production Readiness:** Estimated 4-6 weeks with dedicated effort

The system shows promise with its modern tech stack and comprehensive feature set, but quality and reliability must be prioritized before business deployment.
