## ❌ MISSING IMPLEMENTATIONS

### D) Voice-to-CRM Auto-Logging - ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
**Required:** `backend/app/services/call_transcription.py` (400 lines)

**Status:** Voice AI has basic transcription enabled via Bland.ai, but missing dedicated service for:
- ❌ Automatic transcription of all phone conversations
- ❌ AI-powered action item extraction
- ❌ Automatic lead status updates based on call content
- ❌ Auto-scheduling of follow-ups
- ❌ Compliance recording and archival

**What Exists:**
- Basic transcription flag in VoiceAI configuration
- Call recording stored in VoiceInteraction model
- Sentiment analysis captures some intent
- Manual status updates via API

**What's Missing:**
```python
# Need dedicated service for:
class CallTranscriptionService:
    async def transcribe_call(call_id: str) -> Dict
    async def extract_action_items(transcript: str) -> List[ActionItem]
    async def update_lead_status(lead_id: int, transcript: str) -> None
    async def schedule_follow_ups(action_items: List) -> None
    async def ensure_compliance(call_id: str) -> bool
```

**Required Features:**
1. **Auto-extraction logic:**
   - "I'll send you a quote by Friday" → Create task for sales rep
   - "Call me next week" → Schedule follow-up call
   - "I need to discuss with my spouse" → Flag as decision-making stage

2. **Status Updates:**
   - "I'm ready to move forward" → Update status to "Ready to Close"
   - "I want to get another quote" → Update to "Comparing Options"
   - "Not interested right now" → Update to "Long-term Nurture"

3. **Data Extraction:**
   - Property details (address, roof type, age)
   - Budget range mentioned
   - Timeline/urgency
   - Competitor mentions

**Integration Points:**
- Connect to VoiceInteraction model
- Update Lead status automatically
- Create tasks in CRM
- Schedule follow-up appointments
- Store compliance recordings
