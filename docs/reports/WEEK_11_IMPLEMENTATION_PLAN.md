```python
class MultiChannelOrchestrator:
    """Coordinate campaigns across Email, SMS, Phone, Social, Direct Mail"""

    async def create_campaign(
        campaign_config: Dict,
        target_leads: List[int]
    ) -> Dict:
        """Initialize multi-channel campaign"""

    ) -> str:
        """AI-based channel selection based on engagement history"""

    async def execute_campaign_step(
        campaign_id: int,
        step_number: int
    ) -> Dict:
        """Execute next step in campaign sequence"""

        event_type: str,
        channel: str
    ) -> Dict:
        """Respond to lead engagement (email open, SMS reply, etc)"""

    async def track_campaign_performance(
        campaign_id: int
    ) -> Dict:
        """Real-time campaign analytics"""
```

**Campaign Workflow Example:**
```
Day 0:  Email #1 - Introduction + Property Intelligence
Day 1:  SMS - "Did you see our email? Quick question..."
Day 3:  Email #2 - Social proof from neighborhood
Day 5:  Phone Call (if no engagement)
Day 7:  Email #3 - Limited-time offer
Day 10: SMS - "Last chance" urgency message
Day 14: Direct Mail - Physical postcard
Day 21: Email #4 - Success stories
Day 30: Phone Call - Final attempt
```

**Smart Logic:**
- If email opened → Skip SMS
- If SMS replied → Pause campaign, notify rep
- If no engagement after 3 touches → Try different channel
- If competitor mentioned → Send competitive comparison
- If pricing concern → Send financing options

**2. Smart Follow-Up Cadence Engine** (450 lines)

    async def identify_hot_lead_signals(
        lead_id: int
    ) -> Dict:
        """Detect buying signals requiring immediate action"""
```

**Cadence Intelligence:**
- **Hot Leads** (high engagement): Contact every 1-2 days
- **Warm Leads** (moderate engagement): Contact every 3-5 days
- **Cold Leads** (low engagement): Contact every 7-14 days
- **Dead Leads** (no engagement): Long-term nurture (monthly)

**Adaptive Triggers:**
- Email opened 3+ times → Hot lead, call immediately
- SMS replied → Pause automation, human takeover
- Clicked quote link → Send proposal within 5 minutes
- No engagement in 21 days → Change channel strategy
- Negative sentiment detected → Manager intervention
