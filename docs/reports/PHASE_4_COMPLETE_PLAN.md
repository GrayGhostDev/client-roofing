## 🛡️ Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks & Mitigation

**1. ML Model Accuracy Below Target**
- **Risk**: Models don't achieve 75%+ accuracy
- **Mitigation**:
  - Continuous training with new data
  - A/B testing multiple algorithms
  - Human oversight and feedback loops
  - Fallback to rule-based systems

**2. Third-Party API Failures**
- **Risk**: Vendor outages or rate limiting
- **Mitigation**:
  - Multi-vendor redundancy (OpenAI + Anthropic)
  - Graceful fallback mechanisms
  - Aggressive caching strategies
  - Real-time monitoring and alerts

**3. Performance Degradation**
- **Risk**: <100ms response time not achieved
- **Mitigation**:
  - Load testing before production
  - Redis caching layer

  - Gradual rollout (10%→25%→50%→100%)
  - Feedback loops and iterations
  - Champion program (early adopters)

**2. ROI Timeline Delays**
- **Risk**: Expected ROI takes longer than 12 months
- **Mitigation**:
  - Phased deployment (quick wins first)
  - Weekly metric tracking
  - Adjustment based on early data
  - Focus on high-impact features

**3. Vendor Lock-In**
- **Risk**: Dependency on single vendors
- **Mitigation**:
  - API abstraction layers
  - Multi-vendor strategy
  - Standard data formats
  - Exit planning in contracts

**4. Privacy & Compliance**
