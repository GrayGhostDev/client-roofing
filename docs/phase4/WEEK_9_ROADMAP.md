## ðŸŽ¯ Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks

1. **Production Deployment Issues**:
   - **Risk**: Service downtime during deployment
   - **Mitigation**: Blue-green deployment, automated rollback, extensive smoke tests
   - **Contingency**: Manual rollback procedure, on-call team ready

2. **Model Performance Degradation**:
   - **Risk**: Production data differs from training data
   - **Mitigation**: Continuous drift monitoring, A/B testing, automated retraining
   - **Contingency**: Fallback to previous model version, rule-based predictions

3. **Scaling Challenges**:
   - **Risk**: System cannot handle production load
   - **Mitigation**: Load testing, auto-scaling, caching, database optimization
   - **Contingency**: Horizontal scaling, rate limiting, queue-based processing

4. **Data Quality Issues**:
   - **Risk**: Poor data quality affects predictions
   - **Mitigation**: Data validation pipelines, quality monitoring, anomaly detection
   - **Contingency**: Data cleaning workflows, manual review processes

5. **Integration Failures**:
   - **Risk**: Third-party APIs (OpenAI, Supabase) unavailable
   - **Mitigation**: Graceful degradation, retry logic, fallback mechanisms
   - **Contingency**: Alternative providers, cached predictions, queue for retry
