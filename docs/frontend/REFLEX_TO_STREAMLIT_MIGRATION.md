# Reflex to Streamlit Migration - Progress Report

**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** In Progress (60% Complete)  
**Decision:** Migrate all Reflex dashboard features to Streamlit and deprecate Reflex

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Due to systematic Var compatibility issues in Reflex 0.8.14 that would require 40-60 hours of refactoring, we made the strategic decision to consolidate on Streamlit. This document tracks the migration progress from the Reflex dashboard to the Streamlit dashboard.

**Migration Advantages:**
- ✅ Streamlit already operational and restored from copilot branch
- ✅ Faster development time (estimated 9-13 hours vs 40-60 hours for Reflex fixes)
- ✅ Better community support and ecosystem
- ✅ Simpler architecture and maintenance
- ✅ Enhanced features can be added during migration
