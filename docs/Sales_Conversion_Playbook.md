#### Stage 1: First Contact (0-5 minutes)
**Goal:** Build immediate trust and set appointment
**Key actions:**
- Respond within 2 minutes (78% more likely to convert)
- Use homeowner's name 3+ times
- Ask about specific problem/concern
- Offer same-day inspection if possible

**Script opener:**
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from iSwitch Roofs. I saw you requested information about your roof. What specific concerns do you have that prompted you to reach out?"

#### Stage 2: Inspection & Discovery (60-90 minutes)
**Goal:** Build value and uncover all needs
**Process:**
1. **Arrival protocol:**
   - Text "I'm here" (don't knock aggressively)
   - Wear shoe covers
   - Ask permission before accessing areas

2. **Discovery questions:**
   - "How long have you lived here?"
   - "What's your biggest concern about your roof?"
   - "Have you had other estimates?"
   - "What's your timeline for making a decision?"

3. **Education approach:**
   - Use tablet/photos to show findings
   - Explain problems in homeowner terms
   - Focus on protection, not fear

#### Stage 3: Proposal Presentation (30-45 minutes)
**Goal:** Present solution that addresses all concerns
**Structure:**
1. **Recap problems** (5 min)
2. **Present solutions** (10 min)
3. **Show materials** (5 min)
4. **Explain warranty** (5 min)
5. **Review investment** (5 min)
6. **Financing options** (5 min)
7. **Handle objections** (10 min)

**Price presentation technique:**
"Your investment for complete roof replacement, including [list everything], with our 50-year warranty, is $18,750. With our financing, that's about $215 per month - less than most car payments, and this protects your biggest investment."

#### Stage 4: Objection Handling (10-20 minutes)
**Top 5 objections & responses:**

1. **"I need to think about it"**
   - "I completely understand. What specifically would you like to think about?"
   - Isolate real concern
   - Address specific issue

2. **"The price is too high"**
   - "I appreciate your honesty. Compared to what?"
   - Show cost per day ($1.50/day over 30 years)
   - Offer good/better/best options

3. **"I need more bids"**
   - "That's smart. What will you be comparing?"
   - Provide bid comparison sheet
   - Offer to match written quotes

4. **"I need to talk to my spouse"**
   - "Of course. When can we all meet?"
   - Leave detailed proposal
   - Schedule follow-up within 24 hours

5. **"Insurance should cover this"**
   - "Let's call them together right now"
   - Offer to meet adjuster
   - Show documentation support

#### Stage 5: Closing & Commitment (5-10 minutes)
**Closing techniques that work:**

**The Assumptive Close:**
"So we can get you on the schedule for next Tuesday or would Thursday work better?"

**The Alternative Choice:**
"Would you prefer the architectural shingles in weathered wood or estate gray?"

**The Urgency Close (when legitimate):**
"We have one crew opening next week before prices increase 5% on the 1st."

**The Partnership Close:**
"Let's work together to protect your home. Should we move forward?"
