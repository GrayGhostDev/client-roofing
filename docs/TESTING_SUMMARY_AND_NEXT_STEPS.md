## ⚡ Immediate Actions Required (Next 24 Hours)

### Step 1: Validate Test Framework
```bash
cd /Users/grayghostdata/Projects/client-roofing/backend

# Test the new framework
python tests/test_runner.py --suite smoke

# Expected: Some tests will fail (this is normal - they test real functionality)
# Goal: Verify framework is working correctly
```

### Step 2: Fix Critical Import Issues (if any)
```bash
# If you encounter import errors:
export PYTHONPATH="/Users/grayghostdata/Projects/client-roofing/backend:$PYTHONPATH"

# Ensure all __init__.py files exist
touch tests/__init__.py
touch tests/unit/__init__.py
touch tests/integration/__init__.py
```

### Step 3: Run Security Assessment
```bash
# Install security tools
pip install bandit safety

# Run security scan
bandit -r app/
safety check

# Review security test results
python tests/test_runner.py --suite security
```
