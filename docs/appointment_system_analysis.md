    resolution_options: List[dict]
    auto_resolve: bool = False

    # Resolution strategies
    preferred_resolution: str  # "reschedule", "reassign", "split_appointment"
    alternative_slots: List[dict]
    alternative_team_members: List[UUID]
    customer_notification_required: bool = True
```

#### B. Smart Rescheduling Algorithm
```python
class SmartRescheduler:
    @staticmethod
    def find_optimal_slots(
        appointment: Appointment,
        constraints: dict,
        preferences: dict
    ) -> List[dict]:
        """
        Find optimal rescheduling slots considering:
        - Team member availability
        - Customer preferences
        - Travel optimization

        - Business priority rules
        """
        # Implementation would include:
        # 1. Available time slot identification
        # 2. Travel time optimization
        # 3. Customer preference matching
        # 4. Weather window analysis
        # 5. Business rule application
        # 6. Score-based ranking
```

## 8. Integration Points with Existing Models

### Current Integration Assessment
✅ **Well-Integrated:**
- Lead → Appointment (for initial consultations)
- Customer → Appointment (for existing customer service)
- Project → Appointment (for project-related meetings)
- TeamMember → Appointment (assignment and availability)

### Recommended Enhancement Integrations

#### A. Enhanced Lead Integration
```python
# In lead.py - add appointment scheduling triggers
class LeadAppointmentTriggers(BaseModel):
    lead_score_threshold: int = 70  # Auto-schedule when score exceeds
    response_time_target: int = 2  # minutes
    preferred_appointment_types: List[RoofingAppointmentType]
    auto_schedule_enabled: bool = True
    fallback_team_member: Optional[UUID] = None
```

#### B. Project Milestone Integration
```python
# Enhanced project-appointment linking
class ProjectAppointmentSequence(BaseModel):
    project_id: UUID
    sequence_number: int
    appointment_type: RoofingAppointmentType
    depends_on: Optional[UUID] = None  # Previous appointment ID
    auto_schedule: bool = True
    buffer_days: int = 1  # Days between appointments
    required_outcomes: List[str]  # Required before next appointment
```

## 9. Calendar Component Structure Recommendations

### A. Frontend Calendar Architecture
```typescript
// Recommended React component structure
interface CalendarComponentProps {
  viewType: 'day' | 'week' | 'month' | 'team';
  teamMemberId?: string;
  filters: AppointmentFilters;
  onAppointmentSelect: (appointment: Appointment) => void;
  onSlotSelect: (slot: TimeSlot) => void;
  readOnly?: boolean;
}

interface AppointmentCalendarState {
  appointments: Appointment[];
  availability: TeamAvailability[];
  selectedDate: Date;
  draggedAppointment?: Appointment;
  conflictHighlights: ConflictHighlight[];
  weatherAlerts: WeatherAlert[];
}
```

### B. Real-time Updates
```python
# WebSocket integration for real-time calendar updates
class CalendarWebSocketHandler:
    def broadcast_appointment_update(self, appointment_id: str, change_type: str):
        """Broadcast appointment changes to all connected clients"""

    def handle_drag_drop_reschedule(self, appointment_id: str, new_slot: dict):
        """Handle real-time drag-and-drop rescheduling"""

    def sync_external_calendar_changes(self, provider: str, changes: List[dict]):
        """Sync external calendar changes in real-time"""
```

## 10. Performance and Scalability Considerations

### A. Caching Strategy
```python
# Enhanced caching for appointment system
CACHE_STRATEGIES = {
    "team_availability": 300,     # 5 minutes
    "appointment_slots": 60,      # 1 minute
    "weather_data": 1800,         # 30 minutes
    "customer_preferences": 3600, # 1 hour
    "calendar_sync": 300,         # 5 minutes
}
```

### B. Database Optimization
```sql
-- Recommended database indexes for appointment queries
CREATE INDEX idx_appointments_team_date ON appointments(team_member_id, scheduled_start);
CREATE INDEX idx_appointments_customer_status ON appointments(customer_id, status);
CREATE INDEX idx_appointments_type_date ON appointments(appointment_type, scheduled_start);
CREATE INDEX idx_appointments_status_reminder ON appointments(status, reminder_sent, scheduled_start);
```
