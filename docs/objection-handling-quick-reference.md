## Top 10 Objections & Quick Responses

### 1. "I need to talk to my spouse"
**Quick Response**: "I completely understand. When would be a good time to come back and present my findings to both of you? I'll bring detailed photos and walk you both through what insurance will cover."

### 2. "Can we get a bid?"
**Quick Response**: "With insurance claims, it's different than retail jobs. Insurance companies use Xactimate software with standardized pricing. When your adjuster comes, I'll bring a line-by-line estimate using the same software."

### 3. "I want to talk to my insurance agent first"
**Quick Response**: "Your agent sells insurance but doesn't handle claims. I work with adjusters daily and can ensure nothing gets missed in your claim. Your agent will appreciate that everything is handled professionally."

### 4. "I don't think I have damage"
**Quick Response**: "You may be right! But hail damage is like bruising - you can't see it immediately. The inspection takes 15 minutes. If there's no damage, that's good news for you."

### 5. "I'm just not interested"
**Quick Response**: "I appreciate your honesty. Can I ask what specifically isn't interesting? Is it that you don't think you have damage, or something else? [Listen and address specific concern]"

### 6. "You're disturbing me"
**Quick Response**: "I'm sorry to bother you. Do you know why contractors are in the neighborhood? There's storm damage from last week. I'll take 90 seconds to explain, and if you think I'm selling something, you can close the door."

### 7. "Your price is too high"
**Quick Response**: "Compared to what? Since insurance is covering this, you're comparing deductibles, not full roof prices. The difference might only be a few hundred dollars for 10+ years of additional protection."

### 8. "I want to get other estimates"
**Quick Response**: "That's smart. Let me help you compare apples-to-apples. Ask about insurance experience, local presence, warranty coverage, material quality, and timeline. I'm confident we'll compare favorably."

### 9. "This isn't a good time"
**Quick Response**: "I understand. When would be better? The inspection only takes 15 minutes, and I can explain everything in 20 minutes. Would this evening or tomorrow work better?"

### 10. "I'll call you when I'm ready"
**Quick Response**: "I appreciate that, but insurance claims have time limits. Waiting too long can raise questions about whether damage is storm-related. What specifically do you need time to consider?"

## Emergency Objection Responses

### When Stuck, Use These:
1. **"Help me understand..."** - Gets them talking
2. **"What if I could show you..."** - Creates possibility
3. **"I understand how you feel..."** - Shows empathy
4. **"Let me ask you this..."** - Redirects conversation
5. **"What would need to happen for..."** - Identifies real obstacles

## Trust Builders (Use Early and Often)
- "Check our Google reviews - over 200 five-star ratings"
- "We're A+ rated with the Better Business Bureau"
- "I'll give you my direct cell number"
- "We guarantee our work for 10 years"
- "We carry $2 million in liability insurance"

## Value Statements
- "Less than $3 per day for 25+ years of protection"
- "Getting a $25,000 roof for the cost of your deductible"
- "The most expensive option is usually waiting"
- "Quality contractors are busy because people want to work with them"

## Urgency Creators (Use Sparingly)
- "Insurance requires claims within reasonable time after storms"
- "Material availability becomes scarce after major storms"
- "Existing damage can worsen during future weather events"
- "Roofing season is limited by weather windows"

## Preemptive Phrases
**At Door**: "I'm not here to sell you anything - I'm here to help determine if insurance should cover damage."

**Setting Appointment**: "I'll want both decision-makers present so everyone hears the same information."

**Before Pricing**: "Let me show you what your insurance will typically cover first..."

**Competition**: "Let me help you know what questions to ask other contractors..."

## Red Flags - When to Walk Away
- Immediate hostility or threats
- Clear "Do Not Solicit" signs
- Obviously no damage in clear weather areas
- Previous bad experience they won't discuss
- Unrealistic timeline demands

## Follow-Up Protocol
1. **Same Day**: Send thank you text with your direct number
2. **Next Day**: Email with damage photos and explanation
3. **Day 3**: Call to answer any questions
4. **Week 1**: Check on their decision timeline
5. **Week 2**: Final follow-up with insurance deadline reminder

## Body Language Cues
**Buying Signals**:
- Leaning in during presentation
- Asking specific timeline questions
- Discussing family/neighbor situations
- Taking notes or photos

**Resistance Signals**:
- Crossed arms, stepping back
- Checking phone repeatedly
- Short, dismissive answers
- Looking past you while talking

## Quick Closes
1. **Assumption Close**: "When would you like us to start - next week or the week after?"
2. **Choice Close**: "Would you prefer the 25-year or 30-year warranty option?"
3. **Urgency Close**: "If we can get your claim filed today, we can lock in current material pricing."
4. **Value Close**: "For less than $3 per day, you get 25+ years of protection. That's worth it, right?"

## Remember:
- Every objection is a request for more information
- Address the emotion first, then the logic
- Use their name frequently during conversations
- Always confirm understanding before moving on
- When in doubt, ask questions instead of talking
