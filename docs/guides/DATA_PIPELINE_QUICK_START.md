## 🧮 Understanding Lead Scores

### The 100-Point Formula

Your lead score is calculated from **5 components**:

#### 1. Roof Age (0-25 points)
```
21+ years old = 25 points (URGENT)
16-20 years = 20 points (Decision phase)
11-15 years = 10 points (Considering)
6-10 years = 5 points (Planning)
0-5 years = 0 points (Too new)
```

#### 2. Storm Damage (0-25 points)
```
Major storm (>2" hail, >80mph wind) = 25 points
Moderate storm (1-2" hail, 60-80mph) = 15 points
Minor storm (<1" hail, <60mph) = 5 points
+ Insurance claim filed = +5 bonus
```

#### 3. Financial Capacity (0-20 points)
```
Home value >$750K = 20 points (Ultra-premium)
Home value $500-750K = 15 points (Premium)
Home value $300-500K = 10 points (Mid-tier)
Home value <$300K = 5 points
+ Recent purchase = +5 bonus
```

#### 4. Urgency (0-15 points)
```
Active leak = 15 points (URGENT!)
Requesting quotes = 12 points (Ready to buy)
Visible damage = 10 points
General inquiry = 5 points
```

#### 5. Behavioral Intent (0-15 points)
```
Social media post seeking roofer = 15 points
Requested inspection = 12 points
Engaged with content = 10 points
Website visit = 5 points
```

### Example Lead Scores

**🔥 HOT Lead (Score: 92)**
```
Roof Age: 22 years → 25 points
Storm Damage: 2.5" hail → 25 points
Home Value: $725K → 15 points
Urgency: Requesting quotes → 12 points
Intent: Active search → 15 points
-----------------------------------------
Total: 92/100 → HOT LEAD
Temperature: 🔥 (Immediate action)
Close Probability: 70%
```

**😊 WARM Lead (Score: 68)**
```
Roof Age: 18 years → 20 points
Storm Damage: None → 0 points
Home Value: $850K → 20 points
Urgency: General inquiry → 5 points
Intent: Information gathering → 10 points
-----------------------------------------
Total: 68/100 → WARM LEAD
Temperature: 😊 (Ready to engage)
Close Probability: 45%
```
