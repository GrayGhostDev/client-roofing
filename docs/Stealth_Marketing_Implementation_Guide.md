temperature swings annually. That's like yoga for
your house - lots of stretching and contracting!"

thank you!"

### Stealth Tactics That Convert

#### 1. The Weather Warrior Method
**Concept:** Become the trusted source for weather alerts

**Implementation:**
1. Monitor weather.gov hourly
2. Post warnings BEFORE news outlets
3. Include specific neighborhoods at risk
4. Never mention roofing services
5. Build trust through genuine concern

**Post Example:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è WEATHER ALERT: Birmingham & Troy ‚ö†Ô∏è

Softball-sized hail possible between 3-5pm today.
Wind gusts up to 70mph expected.

Action items:
‚úì Park vehicles in garages NOW
‚úì Bring in patio furniture
‚úì Charge devices (power outages likely)
‚úì Stay away from windows

Stay safe, neighbors! Will update as needed.
```

**Result:** When damage occurs, you're already trusted

#### 2. The Education-First Approach
**Concept:** Teach without selling

**Facebook Group Posts:**
```
"Fun fact: Those black streaks on roofs aren't dirt -
they're algae (Gloeocapsa Magma). It feeds on
limestone in shingles. Power washing makes it worse!
Gentle cleaning with proper products is key."
```

**Value:** Positions you as expert without promotion

#### 3. The Neighbor Nomination Program
**Concept:** Let community choose who needs help

**Implementation:**
```
Post: "Know a senior or veteran who might need home
repairs but can't afford them? Nominate them below
(or privately). Our company provides free services
quarterly to those in need. üè†‚ù§Ô∏è"
```

**Result:** Builds massive goodwill and word-of-mouth

#### 4. The Strategic Visibility Play
**Locations for Yard Signs:**
- Corner houses on busy streets
- School pickup routes
- Near community centers
- HOA entrances
- Popular walking paths

**Sign Design:**
- Company name small
- "Another Happy Neighbor" large
- Include QR code for reviews
- Change monthly for freshness

#### 5. The Partnership Amplification System

**Insurance Agent Partnership Script:**
```
"When your clients have roof damage, they need someone
trustworthy. I'll provide:
- Free damage assessment
- Direct insurance billing
- No out-of-pocket expense
- You get happy clients who renew policies

I'll send you $200 for each referral that closes."
```

**Real Estate Agent Partnership:**
```
"I'll provide free roof certifications for your listings
($300 value). This helps:
- Homes sell faster
