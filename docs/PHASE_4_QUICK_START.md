# Phase 4 Quick Start Guide
## AI-Powered Intelligence & Automation

**Ready to Begin**: Yes ✅
**Estimated Timeline**: 4 weeks (Weeks 8-12)
**Team Size**: 12 agents across 4 specialized squads
**Investment**: $72,000
**Expected ROI**: 15x ($2.5M+ annual revenue impact)

## 🚀 Getting Started in 5 Steps

### Step 1: Run Setup Script (5 minutes)
```bash
cd /Users/grayghostdataconsultants/Development/projects/clients/client-roofing
./scripts/phase4_setup.sh
```

**What this does:**
- Creates all Phase 4 directory structures
- Installs Python dependencies (ML, AI, NLP libraries)
- Generates environment template
- Creates database migration script
- Initializes Python modules

---

### Step 2: Configure Environment (15 minutes)
```bash
cp backend/.env.phase4.example backend/.env
nano backend/.env  # or use your favorite editor
```

**Required API Keys:**
1. **OpenAI GPT-4**: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. **Anthropic Claude** (optional): https://console.anthropic.com/
3. **Robylon AI** or **ElevenLabs**: For voice assistant
4. **Twilio**: https://www.twilio.com/console
5. **Zillow API**: For property data enrichment
6. **Weather API**: For damage correlation
7. **Google Maps**: For geographic routing
8. **AWS Credentials**: For SageMaker ML hosting

**Estimated Monthly Costs:**
- OpenAI: $200-500/month (usage-based)
- Robylon/ElevenLabs: $299/month
- Twilio: $150-300/month
- Zillow API: $500/month
- Weather API: $100/month
- AWS SageMaker: $300/month
- **Total: ~$1,500-2,000/month**

---

### Step 3: Apply Database Migration (2 minutes)
```bash
# Connect to your Supabase database
psql -U postgres -h db.yourproject.supabase.co -d postgres -f backend/migrations/004_phase4_ai_features.sql

# Or use Supabase dashboard SQL editor
# Copy contents of 004_phase4_ai_features.sql and run
```

**What this creates:**
- ML predictions table
- Lead temperature tracking
- Voice interaction logs
- Chatbot conversation history
- Email personalization tracking
- Multi-channel orchestration tables
- Auto-generated proposals storage
- Lead routing history
- Sentiment analysis results
- Model performance metrics

---

### Step 4: Review Documentation (30 minutes)

1. **[PHASE_4_EXECUTION_PLAN.md](./PHASE_4_EXECUTION_PLAN.md)**
   - Complete week-by-week implementation plan
   - Technology stack and vendor details
   - Success metrics and KPIs
   - Risk mitigation strategies

2. **[PHASE_4_AGENT_ASSIGNMENTS.md](./PHASE_4_AGENT_ASSIGNMENTS.md)**
   - 12-agent team structure
   - Individual agent responsibilities
   - Task dependencies and coordination
   - Communication protocols

3. **[TODO.md](../TODO.md)** (original file)
   - Full Phase 4-8 roadmap
   - Detailed feature specifications
   - API endpoint documentation
   - Code examples and algorithms

---

### Step 5: Begin Week 8 Development (Day 1)
```bash
# Activate Python environment
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate

# Verify installations
python -c "import sklearn, tensorflow, openai; print('✓ All imports successful')"

# Start development server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# In another terminal, start Streamlit
cd frontend-streamlit
streamlit run Home.py
```
