## ✅ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

### Pre-Testing Verification
- [x] All GPT-4/GPT-4 Turbo references updated to GPT-4o
- [x] OpenAI API key is set in environment
- [x] Backend dependencies installed (`pip install openai==1.59.8`)
- [x] Database migrations run (if needed)
- [x] Test data available (leads, conversations)

### Post-Testing Verification
- [ ] All transcription tests pass
- [ ] All email generation tests pass
- [ ] Error handling works correctly
- [ ] Token usage is reasonable
- [ ] Response times are acceptable (<10 seconds)
- [ ] AI-generated content quality is high
- [ ] No API rate limit errors

---

## 📈 SUCCESS METRICS

### Performance Targets
| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| API Response Time | <5 seconds | 95th percentile |
| Transcription Accuracy | >95% | Word error rate <5% |
| Email Open Rate | >50% | vs 35% baseline |
| Subject Line Quality | >80/100 | Quality score |
| Spam Score | >85/100 | Deliverability score |

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues

**Issue 1: OpenAI API Key Not Found**
```bash
# Solution:
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-your-key"
# Or add to .env file:
echo 'OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-key' >> backend/.env
```

**Issue 2: Import Errors**
```bash
# Solution:
pip install openai==1.59.8
pip install httpx
```

**Issue 3: Rate Limit Errors**
```
Error: Rate limit reached for gpt-4o
```
```python
# Solution: Add retry logic (already implemented)
# Or reduce request frequency
# Or upgrade OpenAI plan
```

**Issue 4: Low Quality Outputs**
```python
# Solution: Adjust temperature
temperature=0.7  # More focused, less creative
temperature=0.9  # More creative, less focused
```

---

## 📝 NEXT STEPS AFTER TESTING

### If Tests Pass ✅
1. Mark all OpenAI services as production-ready
2. Monitor token usage in production
3. Set up alerting for API errors
4. Document any edge cases discovered
5. Proceed to Phase 5 implementation

### If Tests Fail ❌
1. Document specific failure points
2. Check API key validity and permissions
3. Review error logs for root cause
4. Adjust prompts or parameters as needed
5. Re-run tests until passing
