## üß™ Testing

### **Local Testing with ngrok**

1. **Start ngrok tunnel:**
   ```bash
   ngrok http 8001
   ```

2. **Use ngrok URL for webhooks:**
   ```
   https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/callrail/post-call
   ```

3. **Test with CallRail:**
   - Make a test call to your CallRail tracking number
   - Check webhook endpoint receives data
   - Verify interaction created in database

### **Manual Testing**

```bash
# Test webhook endpoint directly
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/webhooks/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": "data"}'
```

## üéØ Next Steps

### **1. Production Deployment**
- [ ] Deploy application to production environment
- [ ] Update webhook URLs with production domain
- [ ] Configure CallRail webhooks in production account
- [ ] Test webhook connectivity

### **2. Initial Data Import**
- [ ] Run historical call import (last 6 months recommended)
- [ ] Review imported interactions
- [ ] Verify lead/customer associations

### **3. Team Training**
- [ ] Show team where to find call recordings
- [ ] Demonstrate real-time call alerts
- [ ] Train on interaction management

### **4. Monitoring**
- [ ] Set up webhook failure alerts
- [ ] Monitor API rate limits
- [ ] Track integration health metrics

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **1. Webhooks Not Receiving Data**
```bash
# Check webhook endpoint is accessible
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/test

# Verify ngrok tunnel (if local testing)
ngrok http 8001

# Check CallRail webhook configuration
# Ensure URLs are correct and active
```

#### **2. API Connection Fails**
```bash
# Test API credentials
curl -H "Authorization: Token token=YOUR_API_KEY" \
  "https://api.callrail.com/v3/a/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/calls.json?per_page=1"

# Expected: 200 OK with call data
```

#### **3. Calls Not Associating with Leads**
- Verify phone number formats match (remove +1, spaces, dashes)
- Check lead exists in database with correct phone
- Review phone number cleaning logic in `_find_entity_by_phone()`

#### **4. Missing Recordings**
- Ensure call recording is enabled in CallRail
- Check recording URL is not expired
- Verify permissions to access recording

## üìà Performance Metrics

### **Expected Performance**
- **API Response Time:** <500ms
- **Webhook Processing:** <1 second
- **Bulk Import:** ~100 calls/minute
- **Real-time Alerts:** <2 seconds from call receipt

### **Rate Limits**
- CallRail API: 120 requests/minute
- Webhook delivery: No rate limit
- Recording downloads: 60 requests/minute

---

## üîê Security Considerations

1. **API Key Storage**
   - Store in environment variables only
   - Never commit to version control
   - Rotate keys periodically

2. **Webhook Verification**
   - Always verify HMAC signatures
   - Reject requests with invalid signatures
   - Log suspicious webhook attempts

3. **Data Privacy**
   - Recording URLs contain sensitive data
   - Implement access controls
   - Consider automatic expiration

4. **PCI Compliance**
   - Never store credit card data from calls
   - Mask sensitive information in transcriptions
   - Follow data retention policies
